Welcome to the Dodgeville Middle School Builders Club! We are a student-led group dedicated to community service, leadership, and teamwork. As part of Kiwanis International, we strive to make a positive impact by participating in volunteer activities, service projects, and school events.

Our mission is to help both our school and the local community, all while building practical skills and developing leadership. Whether we’re organizing events, helping out in the community, or working on exciting new projects, we’re always looking for ways to make a difference together!
